                        <p class="body-md"> Lily Pad is designed to last two centuries. The space is built for community. People can gather in sitting circles and interact organically by centralizing walking paths. Spaces are modular, reconfigurable, and useful—catering to all your needs. High-quality materials and well-designed systems will save you money, be more comfortable, and be a great experience.</p>

                        <h2>Welcoming Public Front</h2>
                        <p class="body-md"> Like many American homes, LilyPad originally had a garage jutting out from the front and the walkway to the front door was unwelcoming. The front porch now extends and encourages "porch culture". It now says “Hello people, hello bicycles, as well as hello electric cars.”  A public edible garden in the front yard welcomes neighbors, friends, and family.</p>

                        <p class="body-md"> Citrus, vegetables, spices! These plants are not only tasty and wholesome, but make your yard beautiful. Community gatherings and cooking classes bask in the aromas of delicious plants. Growing your own fruits and vegetables is healthy, saves money, and creates community. It also lets you eat the freshest, most nutritious and delicious produce! </p>

                        <p class="body-md"> Many houses are designed so that people are far apart. LilyPad instead prioritizes spaces that help people connect, collaborate, and play. It's ready to host large potlucks. There are two dishwashers, a cooking and cleaning sink, as well as five areas to chat, play, and connect. It's ready to host workshops or for chefs to teach cooking classes.</p>

                        <p class="body-md"> Conventional buildings off-gas dangerous chemicals known as volatile organic compounds (VOCs). By coupling tight air sealing with a Heat Recovery Ventilation system, your air is constantly fresh, filtered, and oxygenated, filtered every three hours. This means fewer allergens, molds, problems, and keeps you alert and sniffle-free. </p>

                        <p class="body-md"> In LilyPad, tall walls of windows create a seemless bridge between the outdoor with the indoor spaces. The backyard grass comes as close to the door as possible, so you step right out into your lawn. Gathering spaces in the backyard and side yard connect directly to the kitchen and catch the setting evening sun – perfect for dinner parties. </p>
