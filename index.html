<h2>Come Test Drive the Future - Today!</h2>
    <p>The first annual CoHERE Fair will take place on Saturday, September 15th from 11 am - 6 pm! The public is invited to experience the LilyPad Dojo‚Äôs unveiling of the transformation of a 1950s split-level track house into a leading edge sustainable home at 1825 Maddux Drive in Redwood City, CA. Within the same area, <a href="https://driveelectricweek.org/event.php?eventid=1395" target="_blank">National Drive Electric Week</a> offers rides to any interested in the raw power of electric cars, sourced from neighbors and friends around Woodside Plaza, Redwood City. <a href="https://tourdecoop.org/"  target="_blank">Silicon Valley Tour De Coop</a> will also be sharing the space, as bicyclists tour chicken coops, backyard gardens, and neighborhood homesteads.</p>
