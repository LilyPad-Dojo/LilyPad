        <h1>Tour One of the Greenest Homes in the US</h1>

<strong>Saturday, September 15! </strong>

<h2>Come Test Drive the Future - Today!</h2>
    <p>The first annual CoHERE Fair will take place on Saturday, September 15th from 11 am - 6 pm! The public is invited to experience the LilyPad Dojo’s unveiling of the transformation of a 1950s split-level track house into a leading edge sustainable home at 1825 Maddux Drive in Redwood City, CA. Within the same area, National Drive Electric Week offers rides to any interested in the raw power of electric cars, sourced from neighbors and friends around Woodside Plaza, Redwood City. Silicon Valley Tour De Coop will also be sharing the space, as bicyclists tour chicken coops, backyard gardens, and neighborhood homesteads.</p>
    <p>The house itself will be divided into several zones focused on each of the specialized parts of the house. Hear from the experts about what they worked on, and more importantly, the WHY behind it. Tour guides will lead groups through each zone, to ensure a comfortable and in-depth experience.</p>
